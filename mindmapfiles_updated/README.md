## 🧩 System Flow

1. User selects initial interests → stored in Supabase
2. Gemini recommends new topics → stored as `recommended_interests`
3. Articles are generated using combinations of:
   - `current_interests`
   - `learned_interests`
   - `recommended_interests`
4. Inside article, on "Read" button click:
   - If topic is from recommended, it’s added to `learned_interests`
5. Cycle repeats, adapting based on user interaction
